**Tools Used**



Microsoft Excel



Pivot Tables



Slicers



Conditional Formatting



Pivot Charts



(No paid tools were used)



**Step-by-Step Process Followed**

**Data Preparation**



Opened the dataset in Excel.



Converted the data range into an Excel Table using Insert → Table.



Ensured headers were correctly formatted and no merged cells were used.



This allowed pivot tables to auto-update when filters were applied.



**Pivot Table – Sales by Category**



Created a Pivot Table on a new sheet.



Added:



Rows: Category



Values: Sales (Sum)



Sorted categories from highest to lowest sales to identify top-performing segments.



Purpose: Identify which product categories drive maximum revenue.



**Pivot Table – Sales by Region and Segment**



Created another Pivot Table.



Added:



Rows: Region



Columns: Segment



Values: Sales (Sum)



Applied Conditional Formatting (Color Scale) to visually highlight high and low sales performance across regions and segments.



&nbsp;Purpose: Compare regional and customer segment performance.



**Profit Margin Analysis**



Created a Pivot Table to analyze profitability.



Added:



Rows: Category



Values: Profit Margin (Average)



This helped identify categories with higher profitability rather than just high sales.



Purpose: Evaluate business efficiency and profit contribution.



**Interactive Filters Using Slicers**



Inserted slicers for:



Region



Category



Segment



Connected slicers to pivot tables for dynamic filtering.



Purpose: Enable interactive analysis similar to BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.



 **Pivot Chart Creation**



Created a column/bar Pivot Chart from the Sales by Category pivot table.



Used a clean and simple layout without clutter.



&nbsp;Purpose: Provide a visual comparison of category-wise sales performance.
